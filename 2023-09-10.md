I feel very lost. There are so many people that are just convinced of their beliefs on both sides of many isles. How can I reach a state of certaints when doubt and 'contradiction' lives nearby over the hill? I see so many points of data, but no clarity. How can I make sense of it all? I need to build this graph of knowledge, I need to search every crevasse and explore what it has to offer. I see no resolve in anything. The internet has opened my eyes to the infinitude of information that never ends but only expands. I must create something that can search knowledge domains whilst not contradicting itself. There is just too much information for a single life time to sift through to come to any point of conclusion with certaintly. The only answer is collaboration, but not one with chaos, one that is bound by the ruleset of logic, inference, probability. I am sick of humans arguing with each other instead of working things out together. Cognitive bias has ruined mankind, or should i say selfishness, the idea of focus on your own mental stability, has caused everyone to put their beliefs over other's. Only computers can solve this dilemma between truth and bias. Data cannot help here, bias is in everything data. Machine learning cannot help here as it suffers the same fate humans do. We must make a rule system, governs by the language of logic. I have to make a system that I can reason with, that I can see the impacts of different views and how collaboration can lead to truth, and easily see contradictions.
