I feel very lost. There are so many people that are just convinced of their beliefs on both sides of many isles. How can I reach a state of certaints when doubt and 'contradiction' lives nearby over the hill? I see so many points of data, but no clarity. How can I make sense of it all? I need to build this graph of knowledge, I need to search every crevasse and explore what it has to offer. I see no resolve in anything. The internet has opened my eyes to the infinitude of information that never ends but only expands. I must create something that can search knowledge domains whilst not contradicting itself. I have to make a system that I can reason with, that I can see the impacts of different views and how collaboration can make sense
