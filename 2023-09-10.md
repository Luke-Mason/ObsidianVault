I feel very lost. There are so many people that are just convinced of their beliefs on both sides of many isles. How can I reach a state of certainty when doubt and 'contradiction' lives nearby over the hill? I see so many points of data, but no clarity. How can I make sense of it all? I need to build this graph of knowledge, I need to search every crevasse and explore what it has to offer. I see no resolve in anything. The internet has opened my eyes to the infinitude of information that never ends but only expands. I must create something that can search knowledge domains whilst not contradicting itself. There is just too much information for a single life time to sift through to come to any point of conclusion with certainty. The only answer is collaboration, but not one with chaos, one that is bound by the ruleset of logic, inference, probability. I am sick of humans arguing with each other instead of working things out together. Cognitive bias has ruined mankind, or should I say selfishness, the idea of focus on your own mental stability, has caused everyone to put their beliefs over other's. Only computers can solve this dilemma between truth and bias. Data cannot help here, bias is in everything data. Machine learning cannot help here as it suffers the same fate humans do. We must make a rule system, governs by the language of logic. I have to make a system that I can reason with, that I can see the impacts of different views and how collaboration can lead to truth, and easily see contradictions without  years of study and fine combing and the need for self reflectance. I need a calculator for the human belief system. Help me navigate this sea of knowledge where truth seems to always be beyond the horizon and I never reach it the further I sail, but am met with only a sinking feeling of despair, lost and lonely. No matter my beliefs, anywhere I exist, anywhere I stand, it never feels solid, safe, and sound. I want to guard myself from believing something not true, yet I can never achieve it. People say that to save humanity we need to fix the existential threats, but to me, to save it, requires a tree of knowledge, stability of belief, its needs a single truth, a single way, a single life, or society will forever stay fractured, chaotic, and disgruntled.

I feel like the only thing I can hold onto is knowing myself through interacting with myself. What would happen if someone could read my mind. My only safe place would be violated. What would I believe? Is God really real if he is a mind? I assumed it was immaterial? Does the mind cause the electrical neural network to be used? How can it be read then by these AI tools. Maybe mind -> brain -> NN. so NN is reading the output of brain as input from mind? I feel like I'm just making excuses for the mind to be separate to be true yet I have no proof.
