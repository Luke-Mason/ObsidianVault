I am becoming more an more agnostic. I am doubting everything I have ever learnt to know as true. I having been coming to grips with the idea that to know something as true for specifically a worldview comes across as arrogant. To say you know God doesn't exist seems arrogant, to say you know God does exist seems arrogant. Saying I believe that God exists seems to share the same border but is softer in it's aggression. I think I need to be very careful in how i use the words 'certainty', 'know', and 'believe'
