I am becoming more an more agnostic. I am doubting everything I have ever learnt to know as true. I having been coming to grips with the idea that to know something as true for specifically a worldview comes across as arrogant. To say you know God doesn't exist seems arrogant, to say you know God does exist seems arrogant. Saying I believe that God exists seems to share the same border but is softer in it's aggression. I think I need to be very careful in how i use the words 'certainty', 'know', and 'believe'. Stating 'I think' is always the safest approach, but it shows room for doubt. In christianity is there room for doubt? God says to surrender everything, which is 100%. How can I surrender all when there is doubt. I don't think i'll ever become athiest again, my overall belief is that there is a God, but the type of christian denoted as a denomination seems arrogant. To assume that you have the truth, you have the most correct interpretation. Each denomination says the same thing when it comes to them priding themselves on how much they read the bible and how righteous their way of life is. If everyone thinks they know the Book of Revelation, the statement to know, suddenly becomes meaningless to me. Maybe its not so much
