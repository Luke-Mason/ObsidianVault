God gives you a choice, to pay your debt or for you to pay for your debt. 

Word Slave -  Ebed, root word Abad which means to serve - Ebed means worker or servant, there is no hebrew word for slave. It is a word that denotes dependancy. The word is used positive ways like a wordof honor. [Dueteronomy 34:4], [Joshua 1:1], [Joshua 24:29],[Exodus 4:23], [Exodus 7:16], [Exodus 8:1],[Exodus 8:20],[Exodus 9:1],[Exodus 9:13],[Exodus 10:3],[Exodus 10:7],[Exodus 10:8],[Exodus 10:11],[Exodus 10:24],[Exodus 10:26], etc.

Categories of slaves in the bible:
1. The Hebrew - Servant who **voluntarily** work to pay off debt or to acquire land
2. The Foreigners - **Voluntarily** entered into work for the same reasons, they wanted to pay off debt and acquire land, or looking for new place to live.
3. The "bad guys" - The prisoner of wars captured from other armies. They are under a tighter watch, they were a risk to their nation, and are prisoners.

What are the regulations? On theft, divorce, murder the bible says to just not do it. People think that slavery should be the same thing and should be abolished, and not have regulations around it. The reason is that they aren't thinking about slavery the same way the bible is, a faulty assumption that it wasn't consensual and that both parties involved benefit. There are actually mutual benefits for both parties in biblical slavery.

People think the only proper treatment of slaves is there release, however again this is assuming it is the American slave trade type of slavery and is not understanding how biblical slavery pays off the debtors, pays for large expensive things like land, and can even gain a wife with the father's approval from the work done (though not as common).

People say that the proper treatment of a theft is not mentioned except to just not do it.

There is also a point to be made, but is a side note, that on what moral grounds is the person assuming that slavery is bad. First one must justify their moral grounding before stating that it is bad. Either under [subjective morality] or [objective morality]. [Subjective morality] doesn't ground anything in this particular case as the person is accusing another person outside their own mind as doing something wrong, so only an objective grounding must be made before the next step of accusing slavery as wrong can be made.
