There are 5 main things that people think of when they think of slavery:
1. Being kidnapped and taken against your will
2. Stripped of all your rights
3. The slaver can beat and abuse you as much as he/she wishes since you're their property.
4. There's no compensation or benefit for you; only the  slaver benefits
5. You are forced to stay for life against your will

Word Slave - Morally neutral word Ebed, root word Abad which means to serve - Ebed means worker or servant, there is no Hebrew word for slave. It is a word that denotes dependency. The word is used positive ways like a word of honour. [Deuteronomy 34:4], [Joshua 1:1], [Joshua 24:29],[Exodus 4:23], [Exodus 7:16], [Exodus 8:1],[Exodus 8:20],[Exodus 9:1],[Exodus 9:13],[Exodus 10:3],[Exodus 10:7],[Exodus 10:8],[Exodus 10:11],[Exodus 10:24],[Exodus 10:26], etc.

Categories of slaves in the bible:
1. The Hebrew - Servant who **voluntarily** work to pay off debt or to acquire land
2. The Foreigners - **Voluntarily** entered into work for the same reasons, they wanted to pay off debt and acquire land, or looking for new place to live.
3. The "bad guys" - The prisoner of wars captured from other armies. They are under a tighter watch, they were a risk to their nation, and are prisoners.

What are the regulations? On theft, divorce, murder the bible says to just not do it. People think that slavery should be the same thing and should be abolished, and not have regulations around it. The reason is that they aren't thinking about slavery the same way the bible is, a faulty assumption that it wasn't consensual and that both parties involved benefit. There are actually mutual benefits for both parties in biblical slavery.

People think the only proper treatment of slaves is there release, however again this is assuming it is the American slave trade type of slavery and is not understanding how biblical slavery pays off the debtors, pays for large expensive things like land, and can even gain a wife with the father's approval from the work done (though not as common).

People say that the proper treatment of a theft is not mentioned except to just not do it.

There is also a point to be made, but is a side note, that on what moral grounds is the person assuming that slavery is bad. First one must justify their moral grounding before stating that it is bad. Either under [subjective morality] or [objective morality]. [Subjective morality] doesn't ground anything in this particular case as the person is accusing another person outside their own mind as doing something wrong, so only an objective grounding must be made before the next step of accusing slavery as wrong can be made.


[Leviticus 25:39] If any of your fellow Israelites become poor **and sell themselves**... 
You can become poor or pay your debt and voluntarily subject yourself to becoming a slave/servant.

Sport players can be bought and sold but it is for their work not for their souls. 

#### Supposed problematic passage [Leviticus 25:42-46]. 

**Who are the people it is talking about?**
Looking at the Hebrew, the people are called the 'toshab (sojourners)' and also the 'ger (aliens)', which are people that comes from another land and want refuge in Israel for one reason or another, economic, political, or religious reasons, or exiled from their nation. Another word for them is simply foreigners.
**What about where it says people will be your property? **
The word property is assumed here to mean that it is a person that doesn't have any rights, the owner can do with them what they please, hold them against their will and can abuse them. Yes they are their property, but it does not follow what was just mentioned. Let's see what the bible says about how they should treat their 'property'.  

1. "When a foreigner resides among you in your land **do not mistreat them**. The foreigner residing among you **must be treated as your native-born**.** Love them as yourself**, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God." [Leviticus 19:33-34]. 

So a few chapters before the 'problematic passage' we read that they must love them as themselves, to not mistreat them, and treat them as if they are your native-born, and to remember they them too were foreigners. What about another book in the bible because that might have been a fluke. 

2. "**Do not oppress a foreigner**; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt." [Exodus 23:9] 
3. "**Do not oppress a foreigner**; you yourselves know how it feels to be foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt" [Exodus 23:9]. 
4. "**Do not mistreat or oppress a foreigner**, for you were foreigners in Egypt" [Exodus 22:21]

What about another book because maybe exodus is poo poo. 

5. "**Cursed is anyone who withholds justice from the foreigner**, the fatherless or the widow" [Deuteronomy 27:19], 
6. "For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, **who show no partiality** and accepts no bribes. He defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, **and loves the foreigner residing among you**, giving them food and clothing. **And you are to love those who are foreigners**, for you yourselves were foreigners in Egypt" [Deuteronomy 10:19]. 

So where are the verses that say you should treat a foreigner as a piece of furniture?
What is interesting is that they problematic passage ends at verse 46, but if we pick up from the next verse we read

7. "If a foreigner residing among you becomes rich and any of your fellow Israelites become poor and sell themselves to the foreigner or to a member of the foreigner's clan, ..." [Leviticus 25:47] 

What about where it says that God must keep the foreigners as slaves for their whole lives? Consider the context in [Leviticus 25:46 (NIV)] "you **can** bequeath them to your children as inherited property and **can** make them slaves for life...," and [Leviticus 25 (ESV)] "You **may** bequeath them to your sons after you to inherit as a possession forever. You **may** make slaves of them...". Nothing says you must or shall.

If you called someone gay back in the day, the word has changed, this also is the case for the slave word.
